# Speech-Recognition-System-with-voice-asistance-
This project is a Python-based Voice Assistant that uses Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies to interact with users via voice. The assistant listens to the user's voice commands, processes them, and responds either with actions or spoken replies â€” just like a mini version of JARVIS!
